  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p class="about">I am a Portland native and have been practicing massage in the area for 5 and a half years! I love my career, but realize it is not sustainable for the long term. This is what lead me to Epicodus! I have a back lab, RZA who takes up most of my free time, but I wouldnt have it any other way.</p>
