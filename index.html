  <h2>The Short</h2>
    <p class="short">Sam is a licensed Massage therapist, practicing in PDX for over 5 years. A dog mom to black lab puppy, RZA who never runs out of energy.</p>
  <h2>The long</h2>
    <p class="long">I was born and raised right here in Portland, OR. Being tired of the grey and rainy skies, I packed everything that mattered and move to Honolulu, HI. After a family tragety brought me back I decieded home is where the heart is- or however the saying goes. I worked hard on becoming a better person, partner and health care provider. I love my career, but it isn't sustainable for the long haul. This is what lead me to taking the plunge and starting at Epicodus!</p>
