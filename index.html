  <h2>The Short</h2>
    <p class="short">Sam is a licensed Massage therapist, practicing in PDX for over 5 years. A dog mom to black lab puppy, RZA who never runs out of energy.</p>
  <h2>The long</h2>
    <p class="long">I was born and raised right here in Portland, OR. Being tired of the grey and rainy skies, I packed everything that mattered and moved to Honolulu, HI. After a couple years of circling a small island, swimming and hiking my heart out I decided it was time to come home. Thats where the heart is- or however the saying goes. Upon returning to Portland I began working at a clinic that I love and over the years have moved into management and learned about what it means to run a small business. Patient care continues to be my priority but I don't see it being sustainable for the long haul. This is what started my research in other feilds and oppurtunities which ultimatly lead me to Epicodus!</p>
